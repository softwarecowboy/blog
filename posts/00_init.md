This is the first blog article, post, entry, you name it. 

# The idea

I have high regard for personal tech blogs and that is for several reasons. First, you have free will in terms of features that you need or use.
Second, it exercises your web development skills, and that comes in handy if you feel *rusty*.

Most important of all, is the ability to share on your principles, without man in the middle.

I succesfully finished my Master Thesis 4 months ago (4.5 btw). It was an end-to-end machine learning project, with a mix of good mlops practices (haha jupyter notebooks go brrr) and an rust infused inference service yada yada. 

Overall, I spent WAY too much time on that, but I took some time off in being creative after hours to recharge and focus on Rust Poland, which I co-founded with my friend Wojciech.

So *Rust with Data* is an extension of what started some time ago - a passion for computer science, rust programming language and data.

## What next?

Well, we will see.

I guess I'll start with introducing myself.

I'm Rafał Waldemar Draws, tech enthusiast and a happy husband. I like music, a lot and I like old cars.

I think that's good for starters.
